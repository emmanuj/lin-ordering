[TODAY]
-- Profile code and eliminate performance bottlenecks
-- Static analysis with Google tools
-- Check how many times that there's no solution in window minimization

[TOMORROW]

-- Make code work well with zero degree nodes
-- Write edge deletion code
-- Include logging
-- Verify that all benchmark graphs can be properly read
-- Fix as many TODOs in the code as possible
-- Document code with comments where necessary
-- Functional Test

TODO
====

-- Performance optimization
-- Testing & Validation
-- Static testing and analysis using Google tools

-- Stable matching [Complete]
-- Integrate with Alg. Distance [Complete]
-- Algebraic distance [Complete]
-- Node by node minimization [Complete]
-- Integrate with stable matching[complete]
-- Filter by Algebraic Distance [Complete]
-- Permuting graph nodes[Complete]
-- .graph reader [Complete]
-- Get all options from command line working [Complete]


Wishlist
========

-- Better and robust graph reader
-- Edge Deletion [Skipped for now. Not sure how using algebraic distance for filtering might affect our results]


Notes from meeting
-- Take off filtering
-- Verify how many singular matrices you see in window minimization
